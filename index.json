An objective in the derivation of such a simplified model, called ABL1d, is to reach an apt representation in ocean-only nu- merical simulations of some of the key processes associated with air–sea interactions at the characteristic scales of the oceanic mesoscale. In this paper we describe the formula- tion of the ABL1d model and the strategy to constrain this model with large-scale atmospheric data available from re- analysis or real-time forecasts. A particular emphasis is on the appropriate choice and calibration of a turbulent clo- sure scheme for the atmospheric boundary layer. This is a key ingredient to properly represent the air–sea interaction processes of interest. We also provide a detailed descrip- tion of the NEMO-ABL1d coupling infrastructure and its computational efficiency. The resulting simplified model is then tested for several boundary-layer regimes relevant to ei- ther ocean–atmosphere or sea-ice–atmosphere coupling. The coupled system is also tested with a realistic 0.25◦ reso- lution global configuration. The numerical results are eval- uated using standard metrics from the literature to quan- tify the wind–sea-surface-temperature (a.k.a. thermal feed- back effect), wind–current (a.k.a. current feedback effect), and ABL–sea-ice couplings. With respect to these metrics, our results show very good agreement with observations and fully coupled ocean–atmosphere models for a computational overhead of about 9 % in terms of elapsed time compared to standard uncoupled simulations. This moderate overhead, largely due to I/O operations, leaves room for further im- provement to relax the assumption of horizontal homogene- ity behind ABL1d and thus to further improve the realism of the coupling while keeping the flexibility of ocean-only modeling.","tags":["WP5"],"title":"A simplified atmospheric boundary layer model for an improved representation of air–sea interactions in eddying oceanic models: implementation and first evaluation in NEMO (4.0)","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":["3"],"content":"","date":1623708000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623708000,"objectID":"cf8932a7952922ed02ae79cb75f0bc31","permalink":"https://immerse-ocean.eu/publications/gmd-12-3571-2019/","publishdate":"2021-06-15T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publications/gmd-12-3571-2019/","section":"publications","summary":"With the increasing number of data produced by numerical ocean models, so increases the need for efficient tools to analyse these data. One of these tools is Lagrangian ocean analysis, where a set of virtual particles is released and their dynamics are integrated in time based on fields defin- ing the ocean state, including the hydrodynamics and bio- geochemistry if available. This popular methodology needs to adapt to the large variety of models producing these fields at different formats. This is precisely the aim of Parcels, a Lagrangian ocean analysis framework designed to combine (1) a wide flexi- bility to model particles of different natures and (2) an effi- cient implementation in accordance with modern computing infrastructure. In the new Parcels v2.0, we implement a set of interpolation schemes to read various types of discretized fields, from rectilinear to curvilinear grids in the horizontal direction, from z to s levels in the vertical direction and using grid staggering with the Arakawa A, B and C grids. In par- ticular, we develop a new interpolation scheme for a three- dimensional curvilinear C grid and analyse its properties. Parcels v2.0 capabilities, including a suite of meta-field objects, are then illustrated in a brief study of the distribution of floating microplastic in the northwest European continen- tal shelf and its sensitivity to various physical processes.","tags":["WP8"],"title":"The Parcels v2.0 Lagrangian framework: new field interpolation schemes","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"The need for setting up a new forum for NEMO users to share experience and tips was raised during one of the splinter sessions of our general assembly in March 2021.
